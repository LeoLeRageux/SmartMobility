# SmartMobility
What's left to do :
- Correct delete a marker bug - this may be due to the polylineIds attribute not being deleted whereas the polylines get updated, resulting in a wrong ID / Polyline combinaison
- Only save markers edits on the edit history after clicking the "Stop editing" button
- Save path name and color in the JSON file
